bridge modern AI architectures and biologically plausible Hopfield
Networks.

## A Universal Abstraction for Hopfield Networks

HAMUX fully captures the the energy fundamentals of Hopfield Networks
and enables anyone to:

- üß† Build **DEEP** Hopfield nets

- üß± With modular **ENERGY** components

- üèÜ That resemble modern DL operations

**Every** architecture built using HAMUX is a *dynamical system*
guaranteed to have a *tractable energy* function that *converges* to a
fixed point. Our deep [Hierarchical Associative
Memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06446) (HAMs) have several
additional advantages over traditional [Hopfield
Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network) (HNs):

| Hopfield Networks (HNs)                                | Hierarchical Associative Memories (HAMs)                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HNs are only **two layers** systems                    | HAMs connect **any number** of layers                                                          |
| HNs model only **linear relationships** between layers | HAMs model **any differentiable operation** (e.g., convolutions, pooling, attention, $\ldots$) |
| HNs use only **pairwise synapses**                     | HAMs use **many-body synapses**                                                                |

## How does HAMUX work?

> **HAMUX** is a
> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph" >hypergraph</a> of
> üåÄneurons connected via ü§ùsynapses, an abstraction sufficiently
> general to model the complexity of connections contained in the üß†.

HAMUX defines two fundamental building blocks of energy: the **üåÄneuron
layer** and the **ü§ùsynapse**, connected via a **hypergraph**

### üåÄNeuron Layers

Neuron layers are the recurrent unit of a HAM; that is, üåÄneurons keep a
state that changes over time according to the dynamics of the system.
These states always change to minimize the global energy function of the
system.

For those of us familiar with traditional Deep Learning architectures,
we are familiar with nonlinear activation functions like the `ReLU` and
`SoftMax`. A neuron layer in HAMUX is exactly that: a nonlinear
activation function defined on some neuron. However, we need to express
the activation function as a convex **Lagrangian function**
$\mathcal{L}$ that is the integral of the desired non-linearity such
that the **derivative of the Lagrangian function** $\nabla \mathcal{L}$
is our desired non-linearity. E.g., consider the ReLU:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(x) &:= \frac{1}{2} (\max(x, 0))^2\\
\nabla \mathcal{L} &= \max(x, 0) = \mathrm{relu}(x)\\
\end{align*}
$$

We need to define our activation layer in terms of the *Lagrangian* of
the ReLU instead of the ReLU itself. Extending this constraint to other
nonlinearities makes it possible to define the scalar energy for any
neuron in a HAM. It turns out that many activation functions used in
today‚Äôs Deep Learning landscape are expressible as a Lagrangian. HAMUX
is ‚Äúbatteries-included‚Äù for many common activation functions including
`relu`s, `softmax`es, `sigmoid`s, `LayerNorm`s, etc. See our
[documentation on
Lagrangians](https://bhoov.github.io/hamux/lagrangians.html) for
examples on how to implement efficient activation functions from
Lagrangians in JAX. We show how to turn Lagrangians into usable energy
building blocks in our [documentation on neuron
layers](https://bhoov.github.io/hamux/layers.html).

### ü§ùSynapses

A ü§ùsynapse ONLY sees activations of connected üåÄneuron layers. Its one
job: report HIGH ‚ö°Ô∏èenergy if the connected activations are dissimilar
and LOW ‚ö°Ô∏èenergy when they are aligned. Synapses can resemble
convolutions, dense multiplications, even attention‚Ä¶ Take a look at our
[documentation on
synapses](https://bhoov.github.io/hamux/synapses.html).

<div class="alert alert-info">
    üö® <strong>Point of confusion</strong>: modern AI frameworks have <code>AttentionLayer</code>s and <code>ConvolutionalLayer</code>s. In HAMUX, these would be more appropriately called <code>AttentionSynapse</code>s and <code>ConvolutionalSynapse</code>s.

## Install

**From pip**:

    pip install hamux

If you are using accelerators beyond the CPU you will need to
additionally install the corresponding `jax` and `jaxlib` versions
following [their
documentation](https://github.com/google/jax#installation). E.g.,

    pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html

**From source**:

After cloning:

    cd hamux
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate hamux
    pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html # If using GPU accelerator
    pip install -e .
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # To run the examples

## How to Use

``` python
import hamux as hmx
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax
import jax.tree_util as jtu
```

We can build a simple 4 layer HAM architecture using the following code

``` python
layers = [
    hmx.TanhLayer((32,32,3)), # e.g., CIFAR Images
    hmx.SigmoidLayer((11,11,1000)), # CIFAR patches
    hmx.SoftmaxLayer((10,)), # CIFAR Labels
    hmx.SoftmaxLayer((1000,)), # Hidden Memory Layer
]

synapses = [
    hmx.ConvSynapse((3,3), strides=3),
    hmx.DenseSynapse(),
    hmx.DenseSynapse(),
]

connections = [
    ([0,1], 0),
    ([1,3], 1),
    ([2,3], 2),
]

rng = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
param_key, state_key, rng = jax.random.split(rng, 3)
states, ham = hmx.HAM(layers, synapses, connections).init_states_and_params(param_key, state_key=state_key);
```

Notice that we did not specify any output channel shapes in the
synapses. The desired output shape is computed from the layers connected
to each synapse during `hmx.HAM.init_states_and_params`.

We have two fundamental objects: `states` and `ham`. The `ham` object
contains the connectivity structure of the HAM (e.g.,
layer+synapse+hypergraph information) alongside the **parameters** of
the network. The `states` object is a list of length `nlayers` where
each item is a tensor representing the neuron states of the
corresponding layer.

``` python
assert len(states) == ham.n_layers
assert all([state.shape == layer.shape for state, layer in zip(states, ham.layers)])
```

We make it easy to run the dynamics of any HAM. Every `forward` function
is defined external to the memory and can be modified to extract
different memories from different layers, as desired. The general steps
for any forward function are:

1.  Initialize the dynamic states
2.  Inject an initial state into the system
3.  Run dynamics, calculating energy gradient at every point in time.
4.  Return the layer state/activation of interest

``` python
def fwd(model, x, depth=15, dt=0.1):
    """Assuming a trained HAM, run association with the HAM on batched inputs `x`"""
    # 1. Initialize model states at t=0. Account for batch size
    xs = model.init_states(x.shape[0])
    
    # Inject initial state
    xs[0] = x 

    energies = []
    for i in range(depth):
        energies.append(model.venergy(xs)) # If desired, observe the energy
        dEdg = model.vdEdg(xs)  # Calculate the gradients
        xs = jtu.tree_map(lambda x, stepsize, grad: x - stepsize * grad, xs, model.alphas(dt), dEdg)

    
    # Return probabilities of our label layer
    probs = model.layers[-2].activation(xs[-2])
    return jnp.stack(energies), probs
```

``` python
batch_size=3
x = jax.random.normal(jax.random.PRNGKey(2), (batch_size, 32,32,3))
energies, probs = fwd(ham, x, depth=20, dt=0.3)
print(probs.shape) # batchsize, nclasses
assert jnp.allclose(probs.sum(-1), 1)
```

## The Energy Function vs the Loss Function

We use JAX‚Äôs autograd to descend the energy function of our system AND
the loss function of our task. The derivative of the energy is always
taken wrt to our *states*; the derivative of the loss function is always
taken wrt our *parameters*. During training, we change our parameters to
optimize the *Loss Function*. During inference, we assume that
parameters are constant.

**Autograd for Descending Energy**

Every [`HAM`](https://bhoov.github.io/hamux/ham.html#ham) defines the
energy function for our system, which is everything we need to compute
memories of the system. Naively, we can calculate $\nabla_x E$: the
derivative of the energy function wrt the *states* of each layer:

``` python
stepsize = 0.01
fscore_naive = jax.grad(ham.energy)
next_states = jax.tree_util.tree_map(lambda state, score: state - stepsize, states, fscore_naive(states))
```

But it turns out we improve the efficiency of our network if we instead
take $\nabla_g E$: the derivative of the energy wrt. the *activations*
instead of the *states*. They have the same local minima, even though
the trajectory to get there is different. Some nice terms cancel, and we
get:

$$\nabla_g E_\text{HAM} = x + \nabla_g E_\text{synapse}$$

``` python
stepsize = 0.01
def fscore_smart(xs):
    gs = ham.activations(xs)
    return jax.tree_util.tree_map(lambda x, nabla_g_Esyn: x + nabla_g_Esyn, xs, jax.grad(ham.synapse_energy)(gs))

next_states = jax.tree_util.tree_map(lambda state, score: state - stepsize, states, fscore_smart(states))
```
